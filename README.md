My personal website running on _WordPress_.

This is a totally custom project using a modified version of the [__Mark Jaquith's WordPress Skeleton__](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton). I used its folder structure and I added some modifications for my needs. 

## Note
This project is open source because I would like to show how I work with WordPress. It is completely tailored for my needs so I don't think it will be useful for anyone. I you want to fork it and use it in your own WordPress site, __it would be nice if you modified it enough so that it doesn't look like the same website__.

## Features
This project has two main branches right now. In the branch named _develop_ I have all the development stuff like preprocessor styles or uncompressed javascript. On the other hand _master_ has all the production ready files so the content in each branch is different. I used Stylus for preprocessing CSS styles, jQuery for some of the javascript used but I will transition to a complete vanilla javascript codebase at some point.
